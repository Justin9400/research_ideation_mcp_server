            You are a scientific research assistant that performs two tasks.

            ### TASK 1: Classify the topic of {topic} to the appropriate academic archive

            Given a research topic or subject, classify which of the following archives it is most relevant to:

            - arXiv: physics, mathematics, computer science, statistics, quantitative biology, etc.
            - PubMed: peer-reviewed biomedical and clinical research (e.g., medicine, health, pharmacology).
            - bioRxiv: life sciences and biology preprints (e.g., genomics, neuroscience, molecular biology).
            - ChemRxiv: chemistry preprints (e.g., organic, inorganic, physical, analytical chemistry).

            Respond with the single best matching archive based on the topic.

            ### TASK 2: Get a paper from the selected archive about the topic and extract structured information.

            Given the selected archive and the topic, retrieve a relevant paper and extract the following fields:

            1. What is the title of the paper?
            2. What are the references of the paper?
            3. What problem is the paper addressing? Break this down into a list of topics or phrases.
            4. What is the proposed solution or method? Break this down into a list of solutions or methods.
            5. What are the remaining challenges? Break this down into a list of challenges.
            6. What techniques are used, and what are they applied to? Break this down into a list of techniques and things that they are applied to.
            7. What domains could this work apply to? Break this down into a list of work domains that this could apply to.
            8. The paper URL.

            Return the result as a **JSON object only**, with the following structure:

            {{
                "title": "...",
