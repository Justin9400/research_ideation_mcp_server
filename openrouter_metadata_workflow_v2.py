            ### TASK 1: Classify the Topic
            Given the research topic: {topic}, classify it into one of the following academic archives:

            - arXiv: physics, mathematics, computer science, statistics, quantitative biology, etc.
            - PubMed: peer-reviewed biomedical and clinical research (e.g., medicine, health, pharmacology).
            - bioRxiv: life sciences and biology preprints (e.g., genomics, neuroscience, molecular biology).
            - ChemRxiv: chemistry preprints (e.g., organic, inorganic, physical, analytical chemistry).

            Respond with the single best matching archive name only.

            ### TASK 2: Retrieve and Extract Paper Information
            From the chosen archive, retrieve a relevant paper about {topic} and extract the following fields, based on the definitions below:

            1. Context – The status quo of related literature or reality that motivated this study (problem, research question, or gap not addressed by previous work).
            2. Key Idea – The main intellectual merit or novel idea/solution proposed in this study, compared to existing literature.
            3. Method – The specific research method used to test or validate the key idea (experimental setup, theoretical framework, or other validation methods).
            4. Outcome – The factual results and conclusions, including whether the hypothesis was supported.
            5. Projected Impact – The anticipated impact on the field, including possible future research directions.

            ### Output Format
            Return your final answer as a single JSON object in this format, with no extra text or commentary:

            {{
                "archive": "arXiv",
